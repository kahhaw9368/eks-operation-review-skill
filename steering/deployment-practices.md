# Deployment Practices

## Purpose
Assess deployment strategies, CI/CD integration, and graceful shutdown configuration.

## Automation Note
CI/CD pipeline details (approval gates, post-deployment tests) are not fully detectable from cluster state. The skill checks for tool presence and configuration; process maturity items are marked UNKNOWN.

## Checks to Execute

### 8.1 — Deployment Strategy & Rollback

**What to check:**
- Deployment strategies in use (RollingUpdate vs Recreate)
- maxUnavailable and maxSurge settings (defaults are risky for small replica counts)
- Argo Rollouts resources
- Flagger Canary resources
- terminationGracePeriodSeconds and preStop hooks

**How to check:**
1. List Deployments → inspect `spec.strategy.type`, `rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable`, `rollingUpdate.maxSurge`
2. Flag deployments with replicas <= 4 and default maxUnavailable: 25%
3. List Rollouts (Argo Rollouts CRD, if exists)
4. List Canaries (Flagger CRD, if exists)
5. Inspect Deployments for `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` and `lifecycle.preStop`

**Rating:**
- 🟢 GREEN: Zero-downtime strategy (maxUnavailable: 0), graceful shutdown configured
- 🟡 AMBER: Rolling update but default settings, or no progressive delivery
- 🔴 RED: Deployments cause downtime, no graceful shutdown
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Cannot determine rollback speed or process — suggest user investigate

### 8.2 — CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**What to check:**
- ECR repositories: scan-on-push, tag immutability
- Admission webhooks enforcing image policies
- Image registries in use (ECR vs public)

**How to check:**
1. Describe ECR repositories → scanOnPush, imageTagMutability
2. List ValidatingWebhookConfigurations → filter for image/policy-related names
3. List running pods → aggregate image registries

**Rating:**
- 🟢 GREEN: Images scanned in CI, private registry, admission enforcement
- 🟡 AMBER: Pipeline exists but no scanning, or no admission enforcement
- 🔴 RED: No CI/CD evidence, images from untrusted public registries
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Cannot determine full pipeline from cluster state — suggest user investigate

### 8.3 — Graceful Shutdown & Connection Draining

**What to check:**
- Deployments with preStop hooks vs without
- terminationGracePeriodSeconds (default 30s vs customized)
- Services with AWS Load Balancer annotations (deregistration delay matters)
- Ingress resources with target group attributes

**How to check:**
1. List Deployments → count those with `lifecycle.preStop` vs without
2. List Deployments → check `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (null = default 30s)
3. List Services → check for `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type` annotation
4. List Ingresses → check for `alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-group-attributes` annotation

**Rating:**
- 🟢 GREEN: preStop hooks on all externally-facing deployments, grace period tuned, LB drain aligned
- 🟡 AMBER: Some deployments have preStop but not all
- 🔴 RED: No preStop hooks and experiencing 502s, or grace period too short
- ⬜ UNKNOWN: Cannot determine if 502s occur during deployments — suggest user investigate

**Key talking point:** There's a race condition during pod termination. The LB still sends traffic for a few seconds after SIGTERM. A preStop sleep of 5-10s fixes it.

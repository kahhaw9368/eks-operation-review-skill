# Report Generation

## Purpose
After all section checks are complete, generate the EKS Operation Review report.

## Consistency Checks (MANDATORY before writing)

Before writing the report, validate consistency:

1. **Build a master list** of all findings with their ratings from sections 01-10
2. **For each RED item:** confirm it appears in "Critical" or "Important" prioritized actions
3. **For each AMBER item:** confirm it appears in "Important" or "Quick Wins"
4. **For the Executive Summary:** only mention ratings that match the master list — do not call something a "critical gap" if it's AMBER, or omit a RED from the summary
5. **For Prioritized Actions:** every entry must reference the finding ID (e.g., "4.1 — Control Plane Logging")

## Workflow

### Step 1: Build Master Finding List

```
| Section | Item ID | Item Name | Rating |
```

### Step 2: Calculate Maturity Score

- Count GREEN, AMBER, RED, UNKNOWN
- Calculate percentages (exclude UNKNOWN from denominator)

### Step 3: Write Executive Summary

From the master list, identify:
- **Top strengths** (GREEN items with highest operational impact)
- **Top gaps** (RED items, ordered by blast radius: security > availability > cost)
- Write 2-3 paragraphs. Every rating mentioned must match the master list.

### Step 4: Write Findings Tables

One table per section. Every item from the master list must appear.

### Step 5: Write Prioritized Actions

Cross-reference against the master list:
- **Critical (30 days):** All RED items. Column: `Finding | Action | References`
- **Important (90 days):** All AMBER items. Column: `Finding | Action | References`
- **Quick Wins:** Items (RED or AMBER) fixable in < 1 hour. Column: `Finding | Action | Effort | Impact | References`

Every entry must include the finding ID and name (e.g., "4.1 — Control Plane Logging 🔴").

### Step 6: Write Investigate Manually

All UNKNOWN items with specific questions the user should answer.

### Step 7: Apply AWS Reference Links

Use the pre-verified reference map below. Do NOT call the AWS Documentation MCP server — it adds latency and token cost with minimal benefit.

Do NOT fabricate URLs beyond this list. If a finding doesn't match a specific URL above, use the fallback section-level page.

### Step 8: Final Consistency Validation

Before outputting, scan the report for:
- Any RED item missing from Prioritized Actions → add it
- Any item mentioned in Executive Summary with wrong rating → fix it
- Any Prioritized Action without a finding ID → add the ID

### Step 9: Write the Report File

Write the report to the **workspace directory**. The file must be created inside the current workspace.

**Filename format:** `EKS-Operation-Review-<cluster-name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHMM>.md`

**Example:** `EKS-Operation-Review-demo-cluster-2026-03-22-1830.md`

The file should be written to the workspace root or a `reports/` subfolder within the workspace. Do NOT use absolute paths outside the workspace.

### Step 10: Offer HTML Conversion

Ask: "Would you like me to convert the report to HTML?"

If yes, run the conversion script — do NOT generate HTML manually. Execute this command:

```bash
python3 report_to_html.py <report-filename>.md
```

Run this from the workspace root where `report_to_html.py` is located. If the script is not found in the workspace root, check `tools/report_to_html.py`.

Do NOT create HTML by hand. Always use the script.
